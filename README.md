# Twitter Profile Analysis -  Big Data Analytics 
## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze Twitter user data to identify **misclassified human and non-human profiles**, using a combination of big data analytics techniques following the **Big Data Analytics Lifecycle**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: Twitter user dataset originally created for a gender prediction task by CrowdFlower.
- **Size**: ~20,050 rows
- **Features**: username, tweet text, profile metadata (color, link, image), and more.

## 🚀 Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Big Data Analytics Lifecycle
- Project planning and lifecycle phase design
- Problem definition, data acquisition, and preparation

### ✅ Task 2: Data Processing and Modeling
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Applied models:
  - Regression
  - Classification (Random Forest, Naive Bayes)
  - Clustering (KMeans, DBSCAN)
  - Association Rules
  - Text Processing (TF-IDF, NLP preprocessing)

### ✅ Task 3: Visualization and Evaluation
- Plots to interpret results
- Confusion matrices, cluster plots, and rule visualizations

### ✅ Task 4: Profile Analysis
- Multi-view analysis: tweet content, color, profile image/text
- Suggested re-labeling based on learned patterns
